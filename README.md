# stream-tools

A little set of tools I use for streaming.

## Tools

### Message

At `/message` is a page used for "starting soon" style screens. The message can
be set using the `text` query parameter, such as
`/message?text=starting%20soon`.

The screen is hardcoded to 1920 by 1080 pixels to make the layout easier to
manage.

## Development

Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to run the site locally for
development.
